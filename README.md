# Aishwar Manickavel - Industrial & Process Engineering Portfolio

> Engineering smarter systems for a world that never stops evolving.

## About Me

I'm Aishwar, an engineer who loves blending analytics, design, and empathy to craft processes that truly work for people and systems alike.

**Philosophy**: Engineering, to me, is where collective intelligence meets imagination ‚Äî building systems that transcend what the human mind once deemed impossible.

Some people see a product; I see the story of materials, processes, and decisions that brought it to life. My journey began with a fascination for metals ‚Äî how they're extracted, shaped, and optimized for performance. That curiosity evolved into a degree in Metallurgical Engineering and later, a master's in Industrial Engineering, where I learned to integrate efficiency, quality, and innovation into the manufacturing process.

Today, my focus lies in designing intelligent, data-driven systems that connect people, processes, and technology. Whether it's optimizing workflows, developing digital twins, or driving process improvements, I aim to engineer solutions that are not only efficient but sustainable and adaptable.

**Status**: üü¢ Open to Collaborations in Engineering Innovation & Process Design
